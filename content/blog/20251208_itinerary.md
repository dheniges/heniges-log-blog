When we tell folks we're traveling the world, one of the first questions is often "where are you going?" It's a great question, but not one we have a concrete answer to. But here's what we know:

**January**  
We're traveling the local world in our van and utilizing our Indy Ski Pass to hit some PNW and BC mountains. Please pray for snow!

**February**  
$300 plane ticket to India you say? Yes please, we'll take two. We're flying in and out of Bengaluru, and I would really, really love to see some wild Bengal tigers! Whether or not this happens, who knows, but it is highly likely we will see some spectacular wildlife and we will get a chance to explore part of Southern India, in the states of Karnataka, Kerala, and maybe Tamil Nadu. I'm very excited, although as the departure creeps closer I like to second guess whether or not I should plan out the itinerary in detail or not.

**March**  
We fly to Bogotá! I definitely want to visit Colombia, but also we need to be on the right side of the globe to sail across the Pacific. The departure window is mid-March - April. So we may or may not have time to explore Colombia a bit. If we don't have time, there's a good chance we'll be back later in the year.

**April**  
Sail! Although given we're not exactly sailing experts, I'm preparing for my time onboard as chef, barista, deckhand, and nightwatchman. And by preparing I mean I've given it a few minutes of thought here and there. I have done a little sailing, as a member of the UW Yacht Club in college, and as a passenger on a few overnight trips and daytrips. I've also watched a number of YouTube sailors and read a few books. Fortunately the actual crew, my sister and her husband, have been preparing for this trip for years. I highly recommend [Sailing with Phoenix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4scuIz1T28) for my favorite sailing YouTube channel.

**Eventually**  
We'll wind up in Australia to visit my other sister. And from there parts of SE Asia, likely Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and perhaps Taiwain, South Korea, or who knows?

Following SE Asia, the tenative plan is to return to the Americas, but in Central or South America. There are a lot of countries I want to visit, but a route through Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Argentina is possible. And then some time in Central America, including Costa Rica and... ?

A lot of it will depend on travel costs. If we can nab cheap flights, we're much more likely to show up there!

We'd like to spend a month somewhere in Central or South America taking Spanish lessons at a school. We've both been learning a bit of Spanish for the last year, from bits of Duolingo and watching a lot of Spanish learner content with Dreaming Spanish. And the last few months I started taking Spanish lessons with an awesome teacher online. I can at least speak enough to convey basic things now, and I can understand a fair bit more. Thus the heavier itinerary in Spanish-speaking places.
