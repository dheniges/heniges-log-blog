As I'm staring out at the unending rainfall (don't look at the forecast!), I have to wonder if we picked the wrong month to leave. It seemed like it would be putting a nice bow on things to finish out the end of the year with work, and do some skiing in January. I'll certainly be a fervent Pray For Snow cult member this year! And at least we've gotten to close out the year spending time with family. But as the rain continues to soak everything, I'm reminded early winter and early spring are less than ideal around here.

Oh right, so what is going on here? Well we (me, Dirk, and my wife, Sarah, who you will hear from regularly as well) decided to travel the world for a year. But DO NOT FEAR! We are not starting a youtube channel. We are not becoming influencers. There will be no sponsored posts. And if we do fall to the dark side and start a youtube channel, it will probably exclusively be videos of birds. Half of you are probably pretty stoked for Dirk Does Birds™ YouTube, and the other half rightfully terrified.

Traveling for extended periods is something I've never really done except for a six week study abroad in Sierra Leone. Sarah's got a bit more experience having also done a college backpacker tour of Europe. So we're by no means experts, but having dipped our toes into a variety of places around the world the logistics aren't worrisome. Spending that much time outside of the daily life I've become accustomed to, well, that's a different question. Oh and then there's the part where we're going to be sailing across the Pacific with my sister on a 40' sailboat!

More to come, but as the Brits say, Top Banana 🍌! Confession: I actually have no idea if this is something Brits say. But _a_ Brit said it recently, and I find it highly satisfying.
