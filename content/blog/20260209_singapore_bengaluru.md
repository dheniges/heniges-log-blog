Sarah here! Dirk has finally convinced me to start pulling my own weight on this blog. [Editor's note: about damn time!]

Maybe it was the pod hotel? Let me back up a bit.

We survived our 17 hour flight from Seattle to Singapore. Stood in awe of the airport (tons of live plant walls, they even have what is apparently the world’s tallest indoor waterfall). But somehow this is the only photo I took:

We tapped our credit cards at the turnstile to take the subway for a pleasant $0.08 ride into the city without any hassle. Rides in India we’ve come to discover are similarly cheap but involve 1000x the hoops.

I may have convinced Dirk to let us try a pod hotel, which is apparently just a glorified bunk bed in a hostel (to keep any AC from actually permeating in). Our room was accessed via a door straight off the dining room in the restaurant next door. But hey, ‘twas an experience. 

Singapore at night! We probably need to return for more than just 15 hours.

Next up, Bengaluru India! I learned very quickly on our ride from the airport that lane markings mean absolutely nothing in India. I would also love to know the Morse code behind the different car horns. It’s a constant symphony and essential to the game of chicken played by all the car drivers, busses, tuk tuks, and even cyclists in spandex on the highway. Everyone seems to know the exact size of their vehicle down to a few millimeters because that is how close people are passing each other in a zigzag. Also, if you’re sitting on the left side of 4 “lanes” and want to go right, no problem, just go for it! And when an ambulance shows up everyone joins in an even louder honking fest that still doesn't appear to make the ambulance any more successful in navigating through the traffic.

I would have taken a video but I was too busy holding onto the seat.

Tuk tuks we’ve found are more comfortable in the heat with the breeze and can even turn into an impromptu tour of the sites of the city if you get the right driver. 

Exhibit A: impromptu stop at the legislative house in Bengaluru.

Entrance to the Malleshwaram temple:

One of our best meals so far was this one served on a banana leaf. The courses were unending. Getting better at eating with just the fingers in our right hand. With helpful tidbits from the waiter that translated occasionally such as “why are you eating this pile now, that is dessert you idiot”).*

*loosely translated of course.

Delicious breakfasts. Still not sure how to successfully consume the soup like portion with just the fingers in my right hand.

Tried some local microbrews at a place far hipper than Dirk and I have ever been. Helpfully there was one employee there who’s full time job appeared to be waving the mosquito zapper tennis racket between tables.

A lazy breakfast of poha upma at our lodging. In a nutshell it’s like oatmeal made of rice flakes and then add all the delicious spices and chile flakes and peanuts. Wakes up the tastebuds bright and early! Served with chai of course.

Sending love (and some of this sunshine) to all our people at home! And Go Seahawks! to all my sportsball fans. 

[Editor's note: great post, but uh... what about the birds???]
