So birds are pretty cool guys. I've been watching an Anna's Hummingbird flash its brilliant orange/red/pink throat at me all weekend. I'm pretty sure that means we're BFFs. Unfortunately I don't have a picture, because of course I didn't bring my camera. But if a picture is worth a thousand words, well:

And speaking of birds, I was going through some photos of past trips and realized I've probably always been into birding, I just wasn't willing to admit it. But check out these sweet birds from Patagonia from some years back!
