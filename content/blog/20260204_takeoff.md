We had to say goodbye (temporarily) to our bestest boy last night. It was difficult, because I mean take a look at this guy. It's amazing how much you can fall in love with a furball. But Sprocket will continue to live his best life in Roslyn with his best friend Meadow. We are incredibly grateful to our friend Marne for taking him in ❤️.

And of course I would be remiss not to mention the difficulty of leaving family and friends. We are fortunate to be surrounded by wonderful people, and the last month has been a pleasure of hanging with friends and family old and new. It would be very easy to stay encapsulated in our bubble of awesome people, and I can't help but feel like a bit of an idiot for leaving that. But, as the kids say, yolo (you only live once)! And the kids definitely do not say that because as a middle-aged man I know the phrase.

So we are very excited to take off, but it is also a bittersweet time.

But also a great time to buy this pair of skis! And new skis require a shotski, right?

And thanks to Apex for delivering some decent groomer snow for us this season, finally.

And speaking of awesome people, we had a semi-surprise send-off party (we had to know when it was, lest we be off skiing or whatnot and miss our own party). Jamie, it was a blast, thank you for planning, organizing and executing it!

All that is left now is a quick hop over the Pacific! 17 hours quick.
