      Sarah to the rescue with pictures of food!  Did you try the peda dessert (top row in pastry case picture)?  That is my favorite!  Just the plain is really good or sometimes they have a saffron one as well (kesar peda). 

      I will be living through your guys food photos for the next month - living my dream life!

My fan (hi Stina!) has spoken. Time for a food recap. Cause I gotta say, the "continental breakfast" here puts our American version to shame.

I do not guarantee the accuracy of any names of dishes to follow.

Breakfasts (mostly had at our various lodgings) have included freshly fried and puffed puri with aloo masala (potato curry).

We've also had lots of masala Dosa which is like a savory crepe made from fermented rice and lentils. It is delightfully crispy on the outside and filled with a potato curry. It usually comes with a tomato chutney and a coconut chutney plus a spicy sambar (a soupy flavor explosion is the best way I can describe it). There is nothing like a level 5 spicy dish to wake you up in the morning.

We've had poha which is rice flakes cooked with spices, peanuts, and curry leaves. Served with a cilantro/mint chutney.

For lunches we tried this inclusive meal all served on a banana leaf. I would have taken more pictures of the 10+ additional things they added but my hand was too messy from eating. Eating with your fingers (right hand only allowed!) is definitely something that comes with a steep learning curve but we're slowly getting more talented at it.

Here's an Indian take on egg on toast (like scrambled eggs but with tomato and spices).

We’ve tried a couple chicken biryani dishes which are always delicious. The way they make crispy red onions here to top dishes is scrumptious. Served with raita (a yogurt dish) of course.

Here we tried churimuri which is a regional street food of puffed rice with onion, shredded carrot, lots of garlic and spices. I really want to try all the street food but we’ve limited ourselves to only a few on a food tour where the guide hand picked them for hygiene. I’m learning “hygienic” (or otherwise) is included frequently in restaurant reviews.

Single use plastic is mostly banned around here so I’ve been enjoying the chai in traditional metal cups.

Dinners typically happen around 8:30 or 9 here so adapting to lying down right after eating my body weight in food is interesting. But one can’t not try all the delicious food, right?

Here we had lemon rice with aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower) and chettinad chicken (spice filled coconut type sauce).

I didn’t get a picture of it but we got a drink of homemade sweet and salty lime juice to go with it. At first the drink was saltier than I’m used to but with each passing sip I actually found it quite addictive. I affectionately refer to it as homemade pedialyte.

Here's a sample of the desserts you see strolling along the shops in India.

We’ve tasted lots of delicious Indian desserts but somehow I ate them all too quickly to get a picture. So I leave you with this apple pie I ate in the mountainous region of Ooty. A little slice of home away from home.
