Well I did not pray hard enough for the snow, and thus it's mid January and 35F outside. But at least the sun is shining! So anyway we loaded up the van this last week and decided to try to take advantage of our Indy ski passes and hit some new resorts. We got a good dumping of snow a couple weeks back, but it seems the storms have mainly stayed to the north and in the Cascades. After heading east to Missoula, we abandoned plans to continue further into Montana and came back home. When we stopped at Silver Mountain on the way home, half the runs we'd skiied earlier in the week were closed because they'd lost so much snow due to the unusually high temperatures.

The only plus-side of the lack of snow for us is that we could go romp around in the woods in Montana with the van and find some cool camp spots. It's always incredibly special to have an area completely to yourself, and I suspect a year of travel will only make me appreciate US Public Lands even more.
