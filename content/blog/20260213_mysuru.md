We started out wandering around on our own, but when you don't speak the language it is a challenge to know what's going on around you, and at times whether or not you're being incredibly rude. Fortunately as a foreigner here we seem to be given immense amounts of grace. Well, usually.

So after our jaunt through the Kormangala neighborhood of Bengaluru, with its fancy BMW motorcycle cafes, we headed south to the city of Mysuru, previously known as Mysore. As one of our guides put it, India has a colonial hangover and many things that were British are still perceived as exotic and interesting. But they are working on reclaiming names, like Mysuru, or the more famous Mumbai which was Bombay. However numerous families wanted to take a picture of us with their child, which we obliged.

So in Mysuru we stayed at this excellent but very Indian hotel, the Yuvraj Landmark, where foriegn credit cards are not accepted. Given it's a block off the central palace grounds I was a bit surprised, but after emptying several ATMs we were in good shape cash-wise.

We opted to do a couple tours in Mysuru and with a little research were lucky to wind up with some really excellent guides and learned a lot about the history of the city and the kingdom of Mysore. Fun fact: one of Mysore's kings defeated the British twice after his people invented the first iron rockets. But after Cornwallis left the US in defeat he rallied a bunch of other kingdoms against Mysore and won.

The other tour was a food tour. Given that literally everyone has warned us against street food in India, we've stuck to clean looking restaurants (which are still incredibly cheap). Given poisoning your customers would likely be bad for business when you're giving foreigners food tours, we figured we'd be fine. And we were right! Our guide was the self-described engi-near (engineer dropout turned English major, much to his parents horror). The man may have had an unhealthy love of puns, but he was a great guide.

Alright enough rambling, it's time to talk about what you all came here for. On week two of our travels, this happened:

I will have more to say soon about our extreme birding paradise!
