We at the Heniges Log Blog love and appreciate our vast audience. Your feedback and support are critical for our tiny empire here in this corner of the web. So we have listened carefully to you, and after an at times contentious board meeting, have decided to look into adding comments to the LogBlog™.

A few ground rules before you animals run wild:
1. This is a benevolent dictatorship. Our Community Review Board (we are busy people and hold many positions here at the LogBlog™) will carefully review all submissions and decide which are worthy of LogBlog-ification.
1. This may be the greatest technological undertaking I've ever undertaken. While we're a long shot from any sort of Artificial General Intelligence, I'm pretty sure the AI is better at technology than some of you.

Ok so only one of those was a rule, the second one was just insulting some of our audience, for which our Customer Care Team apologizes deeply. Please let us know how you feel in the comments. Whenever we get around to launching them.

But remember: you are all loved, heard, and sometimes ignored!

Cheers,
The LogBlog™ Editorial Team
