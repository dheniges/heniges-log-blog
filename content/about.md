# About

You've found yourself on the Heniges Log Blog. It's a log of our travels, in blog form. Ok yeah maybe we watched Arrested Development a few too many times.

Follow along, or don't. We aren't your boss. We're just sharing adventures here on this homespun blog that isn't loaded with ads or trackers. There are no comments. Nobody is making any money whether or not you read this. And that's just the way we like it. Life needs more things disconnected from dinero. So welcome friends!

As for who we are? Just a couple (Dirk and Sarah) that grew up in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. Dirk messes around with computers, Sarah practices very professional medicine. But we're taking a break to travel!
